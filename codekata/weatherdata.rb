# Weather Data is for Morristown, NJ June 2002
# Output the day number (1..30) with the smallest temp spread (max temp - 2nd column, min temp - 3rd column)

# output = number of days p number_of_days
# smallest temp spread = max temp and min temp
# {day => min temp}, am I looking for an average or just the minimum temp?
