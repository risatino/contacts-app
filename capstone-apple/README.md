# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Features:

* Ruby version 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26)

* System runs with Rails 5 framework

This is a prototype for a working capstone-app. It has successfully achieved its MVP functionality and has potential towards a bigger web application. Currently looking into suggestions and recommendations for improvements.
